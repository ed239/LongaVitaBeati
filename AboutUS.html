        <h2>The Inventor </h2>

            <article>
                <p  class="Eden">   Eden Dubrovsky, a graduate of The New Jersey Institute of Technology had created this robot
                during her time in university. Throughout the past few years, it became noticeable that many relatively young
                adults were greatly affected by heart disease. Because of her passion for technology and benefiting society, she
                created a robot that would alter our medical system. After her graduation in 2023, she continued to develop this
                product in order to bring it to the market by 2027. With the addition of the application, users were able
                to receive results at a much faster rate. Eden earned a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Business and
                Information Systems which greatly helped her in the creation of this robot. </p>
