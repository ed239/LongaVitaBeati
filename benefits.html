        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>Longa Vita Beati is the first company to present customers with an easily accessible method of attaining medical
            records. This product requires little to no doctor intervention in the research and analytics stages making it
            extremely user friendly. The micro-robot is inserted into the bloodstream and travels throughout the users veins
            for 24 hours before producing an analysis that syncs to the application available on smartphones.
            The robot collects information on blockage within veins, blood pressure,  and other indicating signs of
            heart disease. The application then processes this information and relays it in a comprehensible manner to
            the user. The robot will also work in collaboration with the apple watch to produce the most accurate health
            analysis that will be readily available. </p>
