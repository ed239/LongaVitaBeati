        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <p class="overview">   Over several decades the leading cause of death in America has been heart related diseases and heart
            attacks. Almost half of the deaths in America are caused by illness seemed from the heart. What is even
            more shocking is that most of these fatalities are the result of cardiovascular diseases- 80% of which can
            be prevented by a change in lifestyle. Cardiovascular diseases include coroner artery disease, high blood
            pressure, cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, and many others. 1 in 4 people have suffered from these diseases or
            are currently suffering from these diseases.  This product will not only benefit millions of America but
            hundreds of millions of people around the world.  Many of these diseases go infected and culminate over
            time to cause more harm to the victims than if detected immediately.  Many instances of diseases being
            discovered could be avoided with proper lifestyles and adequate medical attention. However, many cannot
            afford to purchase medical insurance because of its rising costs. Although there have been implementations
            of fiscal and expansionary policies to make healthcare more affordable, statistics show the the costs are
            on the rise and there are still millions of American unable to provide themselves with the basic requirement
            of visiting a doctor. Even with affordable care acts there are many people in this nation are unable to
            receive care because of the prices. The future of medicine lies in effective and inexpensive procedures
            that will not only help save lives immediately but will also aid in the strategy of prevention. </p>
